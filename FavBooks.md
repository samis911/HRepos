# Samiat Bakare's Favorite Books 
## Books
* Flowers in the attic
* Fault in our Stars
* Once 
* Petals in the Wind
* The Catcher and the Rhye

# I like that the book has a really unique plot that is hard to anticipate. It also has some realigious motifs and really makes you question and think deeply about some societal norms.

# I did not like the book Things Fall Apart because I do not like how they potrayed nigerian men.
